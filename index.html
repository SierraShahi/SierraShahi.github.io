<h1>About Me</h1>
<img src="./profile.jpg" width="300">

<p>My name is Sonam Shahi, and I am from the beautiful country of the Himalayas-Nepal. I can speak Nepalese, Hindi, and English. I moved to Australia in 2015 and currently living with my husband in Sydney. I have a strong affection towards dogs and miss my 13-year-old dog, who is back home. Besides, I am always thinking of ways to help stray dogs back home, whether through donations to social workers who provide shelter to stray dogs or by spreading social media awareness. Before moving to Australia, I lived in Qatar for two years, working for an airline. I love traveling and exploring new places, learning their culture, trying their food, and learning about their history. I got the opportunity to travel to a few countries and meet new people when I lived in Qatar.
 I started my own small online business in 2019, which provides traditional attires to the  Hindu community living in Australia. I am currently utilizing my modeling experience from my teenage years by becoming a model for my own business. I am amazed how IT has helped transform the lives of so many people, including myself. From getting in touch with my family back home to running my online business, IT has played a massive part in transforming my life, and I am looking forward to a great career.

<h1>My Interest in IT </h1>
<p>I have always had a passion for learning about computers since I was little. I got my first computer when I was in grade 6 (2006). Back home, having a computer in those years was a big deal. Although we did not get many opportunities to study using computers in school, I spent hours after school learning about computers, trying to figure out how different applications worked. When I reached year 11(2011), I could choose computer science as an optional subject. I decided to study that subject and quickly became interested in it. That was also the first time I learned my first programming language, QBASIC. Over the years, I have seen how IT has developed rapidly and has transformed our lives. I want to explore the new possibilities and innovations IT can bring to our life so; I joined RMIT to explore my interest in Information Technology.

An Application Developer is a professional who designs, creates, delivers, and updates programs for a specific device, the web, or an operating system (What Is an Application Developer? 2021). I believe that Application development is a rewarding career. I have always worked in a team and understand the power of working in a group.

<h1>Project Idea-HelpPaws</h1>
<img src="./Shrijana_Rescue.width-800.jpg" width="350">

<p>In my country Nepal, there are thousands of street dogs. Unfortunately, many street dogs suffer from starvation and bad health conditions. Although some local community members feed the dogs around them, there are many cases of cruelty shown to dogs by local community members.
"HelpPaws" is a mobile app aiming to rescue stray dogs and find help and shelter. The App allows a person to take a picture of a stray dog and upload it on the App with some description about the dog's condition. After submitting the photo, the App automatically traces the dog's location and sends SOS to the different rescue organizations or community members registered on "HelpPaws" who will rescue the dog.

HelpPaws app aims to rescue street dogs to provide them food, shelter, and care. It also reaches out to the people who are willing to adopt dogs. Besides, many rescue centres are run by donations, and most of the time, they struggle financially to run the shelter. So, this App will also allow people worldwide to make donations to dog rescue centres. Moreover, this App can be used worldwide where a similar problem exists.

</p>
<h2>Features</h2>
<p>In the HelpPaws App, different NGOs, INGOs, and individuals can register their names, addresses, contact details, and interests. Their interest can be following :</p>
 <ul>
 <li>A rescue shelter can enter their interest as "can rescue stray dogs living around 5 km within their location"</li>
 <li>A local community member or people from different parts of the world can enter their interest as "looking to adopt a stray dog" or "willing to donate" to help the rescue shelters financially</LI>
 </ul>


<h2>How it works</h2>
<p> A person who finds a dog in a bad situation can take a picture or a video of the dog using the option available in the App and upload it under the SOS section of the App with some descriptions about the dog's condition. The App automatically traces the location where the picture or video was taken and sends the SOS notification to the nearest rescue centers or the registered person willing to rescue the dog. The organization or a person can either accept or decline the request. When the request gets rejected from the nearest rescue centers due to reasons like overcrowded shelters or financial difficulty, the App then sends a notification to other shelters. Once the request gets accepted, the App sends a "Rescue Successful" notification to the person who reported the case.
The rescuer can also post the status of the rescued dog at the shelter and stories of other rescued dogs. The stories can be viewed by people living around and support the rescue centers by donating through the App. Moreover, the App will also find a home for rescued dogs. People interested in adopting a dog can send a request through the App.
</p>

<h2>What changes can the HelpPaws app bring?</h2>
<p>There are little government interventions in managing stray dogs in a few developing countries. Thousands of animals become victims of violence as many people still consider animals a public health hazard (News - SPCA International, 2021). While some organizations get enough support from around the world, others struggle to feed their rescued dogs. Hence, this App will become a support system for everyone involved in the welfare of the street animals. </p>
<h2>Challenge and Solution</h2>
<p>Marketing the application can be the biggest challenge in the initial phase of launching the new mobile App. It won't be easy to reach every possible client initially. However, as this is a great social cause, various social media and social media influencers can be approached to promote the App. Most people use social media almost every day; therefore, requesting social media influencers to spread awareness and promote the App will help overcome this challenge.
The ultimate goal of the "HelpPaws" app is to solve the problems of excessive street dogs struggling for their daily food, shelter, and poor health condition around the world.
</p>

<h2>Skills and Tools Required</h2>
<p>Knowledge in the modern programming language is essential in developing a mobile app (Top 5 Skills Required for a Mobile Application Developer). Experience in programming languages like Java and C# is essential in developing a mobile app. Besides, this mobile App will provide a better user experience for both IOS and Android users. To develop this App, React Native tool can be used as it is a cross-platform application development framework created and supported by Facebook and quicker to create and implement (Paul and Nalwaya, 2019). React Native allows users to utilize their existing JavaScript skills to create a robust mobile app.
